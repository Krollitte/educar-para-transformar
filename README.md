## Hello how are you ?

If he got this far, it's because he's interested in knowing what this project is. Well, this site was built to complement my wife's college work, the project: "Educate to transform" unfortunately doesn't exist yet, but an important part, your site, has already started.

Built using ReactJs, this site is not responsive yet, but it will be coming soon, and new features will be added as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
